These are the files in this repo representing some of my coding examples:

* **D3-WP-slope.js:** Javascript I wrote to integrate data visualization using the WordPress D3 plugin and create a slopegraph based on a user-supplied CSV of data.
* **widget-all-news.php:** WordPress PHP widget I wrote to dynamically build a CSS hover widget that displays associated PDFs based on the current page 
* **ICS-dynamic.php:** WordPress PHP plugin I wrote to generate a dynamic ICS file for users who register for a given event date and time. The plugin has been customized to generate an ICS file which will open and save in all email clients.
